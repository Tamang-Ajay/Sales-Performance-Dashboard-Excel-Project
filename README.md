## 📌Overview:
I designed an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard to analyze total sales, total profit, and total quantity sold along with trends across regions, segments, ship modes, sub-categories, and (Quarterly and yearly) sales performance from 2014–2017, including profit by region. This dashboard provides a clear and easy-to-understand view of business through interactive and visual reports.
